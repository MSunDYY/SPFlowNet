# A repository forked from [another one](https://github.com/MSunDYY/SPFlowNet)
This is the code for 3D scene flow estimation and is forked from [here](https://github.com/MSunDYY/SPFlowNet).
Different from the origin work,ours is built in python3.9 and cuda11.3,which is more advancing and promising.

We will integrate it into our [detection framework](https://github.com/MSunDYY/OpenPCDet) for data enhancement, and to improve our detection accuracy.
